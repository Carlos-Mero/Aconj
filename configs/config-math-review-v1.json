It should share similar underlying math principles with previous problems, being creative while being careful about the correctness as well. You need to synthesize the reviews showed to you and create your own novel problem. This time your should also respond in JSON format, where we have: `inspiration` which describes your original thoughts about the question you come up with; `question` is the new question you just created; `answer_steps` is your answering steps; `final_answer` is the final answer to this question.\n",

You need to respond in JSON format, which contains only two components: `inspiration` which is your new inspiration added to the original question; `explanation` which is your detailed explanation to your inspiration; Your response is used to guide the other agent to promote its question. You can express your thoughts with math formulas in LaTeX if needed.\n",
